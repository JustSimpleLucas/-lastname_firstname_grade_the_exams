# lastname_firstname_grade_the_exams

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to automate the grading process for multiple classes with thousands of students. By leveraging Python's functionalities, the program aims to reduce grading time significantly.

## Steps

1. **File Handling**: The program should be able to open external text files as requested. Exception-handling mechanisms will be implemented to handle any errors that may occur during file operations.

2. **Data Validation**: For each line of the exam answers, the program will scan and identify valid data. It will provide corresponding reports for any invalid or missing data found in the input files.

3. **Grading Process**: The program will grade each exam based on the provided rubric. It will apply various functions to evaluate the correctness of the answers and assign scores accordingly. Reports will be generated to display the grading results.

4. **Result File Creation**: Upon grading each exam, the program will create properly named result files to store the graded exam data. The filenames will be constructed based on the class number or other relevant identifiers.
